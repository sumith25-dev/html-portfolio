<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sumith B R ,Indian, and my name 'Sumith' means "Good friend.
  " The 'B' in my name represents Bannikatti, which is my house name, and 'R' stands for Raju, my father's name.
   I was born on July 25, 2004, in Davangere, and I'm currently 20 years old(2024).
    I’m studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) engineering in my 3rd year at Bapuji Institute of Engineering and Technology (BIET) in Davangere.
     I started my education at Eshwaramma School and completed my pre-university studies at Siddaganga College, which helped shape my path toward engineering.</p>

<p>Apart from academics, I have a great love for sports, especially badminton, which I enjoy playing whenever I get the chance. 
  I also love watching various sports and following the action, whether it's on TV or in person. 
  Music plays an important role in my life too—it helps me relax and inspires me in different ways.
   I’m a spiritual person, and being a proud Hindu, my faith is something I hold close to my heart as it guides me in my everyday decisions and actions.

<p>I also have a deep affection for animals and feel a strong sense of responsibility toward them.
   My love for animals, along with my interest in sports and music, reflects my compassionate and well-rounded personality. 
   All of these things make me who I am—a person who values kindness, balance, and learning in life.</p>
